# Purpose
#
#   When the MakeMKV tool extracts DVD/Blu-ray titles from disc, it appends a track extension 
#   (_t00, _t01, etc.). This script removes the track extension from all files in the supplied
#   directory by renaming them.
#
#
# Usage
#  
#   strip_makemkv_track dirname
#
#
#
# Example
#
#   % ls ~/Desktop/example 
#   >> fileone_t00.m4v	filetwo_t01.m4v
#
#   % strip_makemkv_track example
#   >> Removing track portion for files in example...
#   >> fileone_t00.m4v -> fileone.m4v
#   >> filetwo_t01.m4v -> filetwo.m4v
#   >> Renaming is complete. 
#
#   % ls ~/Desktop/example 
#   >> fileone.m4v	filetwo.m4v

cd "$1"
echo "Removing track portion for files in $1..."

# Rename all files
for f in *; do 
    newname=$(echo "$f" | sed "s/\(_t[0-9][0-9]\)//")
    mv -- "$f" "$newname"
    echo "$f -> $newname"
done
echo "Renaming is complete."
